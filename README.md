# Selecting the best place for a new restaurant in Toronto.

##  Problem
Before opening a new restaurant it is important to detect where there is a demand for it. It is important to discover which are the neighborhoods that do have few restaurants but also a high amount of other types of venues that will ensure the flow of clients. 

##  Interest
A particular client wants to find the best place for a new restaurant in Toronto.  The restaurant is also going to provide delivery service on a radius of 3000 meters.

## Methodology
All the data was explored, processed and cleaned using Watson Studio and Jupyter Notebooks.
### Data sources
Location data of existent restaurants and other types of venues in Toronto is going to be gathered from Foursquare. Postcodes locations of Toronto are going to be used to search the amount of existent restaurants and other types of venues in a radio of 3000 meters that is the radio for delivery services. 
The list of postcode locations is going to be scrapped from Wikipedia:

We obtain the geographical coordinates of each postal code from:
